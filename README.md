# üèÅ Requirements

{% hint style="warning" %}
This tool will only run natively on **Linux** and **Mac OS**.

**Windows** users will have to use it via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). More info [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/54#issuecomment-984834217).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This tool will be maintained to stay compatible with every Keycloak version starting from [Keycloak Version 11](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/11.0.3).

However, the default pages you will get (before you customize them) will always be the ones of Keycloak [v11.0.3](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/11.0.3) and some extra pages that didn't exist back then like `register-user-profile.ftl.`

Latest release isn't in the list yet? It probably works fine, we just can't confirm it yet.

### Supported React frameworks

{% hint style="success" %}
If you aren't trying to integrate the theme with a preexisting react app, save yourself some time and just use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev).

This tool assumes you are bundling your app with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

It assumes there is a `build/` directory at the root of your react project directory, it's usually generated after running `yarn build`.

The `build/` directory is expected to contain an `index.html` file and a `build/static/` directory.

Keycloakify also assumes there is a public/ directory at the root of your react project that is used to make static files available.

Concretely Keycloakify assumes that if there is a `public/a/b.c/foo.txt` file. This file should be available at `https://localhost:<some_port>/a/b/c.foo.txt` when running your app in test mode (usually by firing yarn start).

For more detailed information see [this issue](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/5#issuecomment-832296432).

**My framework doesn‚Äôt seem to be supported, what can I do?**

Currently Keycloakify is only compatible with SPA React apps. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you can't use Keycloakify if you are using Next.js, Express or any other framework that involves a server but your Keycloak theme will need to be a standalone project.\
Find specific instructions about how to get started [**here**](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app#keycloak-theme-only).

To share your styles between your main app and your login pages you will need to externalize your design system by making it a separate module. Checkout [ts\_ci](https://github.com/garronej/ts\_ci), it can help with that (example with [our design system](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui)).
